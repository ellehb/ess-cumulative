# Building the cumulative ESS dataset

The [European Social Survey](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/) is an awesome resource for political scientists. However, the cumulative dataset provided by the ESS is not updated very frequently. 

(Currently ESS Round 9 has been released but the cumulative dataset only includes Rounds 1-8.)

So, this repo contains some scripts that will enable you to:
1. build a cumulative dataset from the year-specific files
2. create consistent variables for basic demographics and vote intention
