# Building the cumulative ESS dataset

The European Social Survey is an awesome resource for political scientists. However, the cumulative dataset provided by the ESS is not updated very frequently. 

(Currently ESS Round 9 has been released but the cumulative dataset only includes Rounds 1-8.)

So, this repo contains some scripts that will enable you to build a cumulative dataset from the year-specific files, and create consistent variables for basic demographics and vote intention.
